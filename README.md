# Bulk File String Replacement Tool

The Bulk File String Replacement Tool is a program that allows users to make a global change in multiple files located in a selected folder. This tool is designed to facilitate the process of replacing a specific string in a large number of files. With this program, users can replace a specific string in all files located in a folder with a new string of their choice.

## How it works

The program prompts the user to select a folder containing the files they wish to modify. Once a folder is selected, the program scans all files in the folder and prompts the user to enter the string they wish to replace and clean the file projects.
